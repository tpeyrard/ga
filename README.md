_Genetic Algorithm examples._

No tests, only two main files (one per example). 
The goal is to experiment quickly the architecture of a genetic algorithm.

## 1 - A simple binary genetic algorithm
Inspired from http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3

## 2 - The Travel Salesman problem
Based on http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5
